## 🌟 The Problem

The modern digital media landscape is dominated by centralized platforms that act as **powerful gatekeepers**.
This creates a severe **power imbalance** for independent creators:

- **💸 Extractive Fees** – Platforms often take **30–55%** of revenue with **opaque, delayed payments**.
- **🚫 Censorship & Loss of Control** – Arbitrary “community guidelines” can **deplatform** creators without recourse.
- **🛑 High Barriers to Entry** – Securing distribution deals is a **major hurdle** for many talented filmmakers.
- **⚠ Platform Risk** – Sudden changes in terms of service can **destroy a creator’s livelihood** overnight.
